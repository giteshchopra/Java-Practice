# Java-Practice
These are a few questions I practiced for sharpening my Java skills.
1st is a challenging multi-threaded programming problem and 2nd is based on Collections Framework in Java.


Q1= Write a Java Program to simulate a banking system. The requierements are given below.


Consider a bank with 100 accounts. The bank responds to the operation(deposit and withdrawal) 
from different users (Consider employer and employee as users for each account , 
i.e total 100 employees and 1 employer). Employer will add money in the account and accordingly employee can withdraw.
Employee can withdraw only when the amount is available 
if not employee will wait till the amount is available.
Print the user name while doing any operation(withdraw / deposit).
